thenerve is supposed to be a sarcastic name to a cli tool that is supposed to take a SQL file or
a bunch of SQL files and generate a diff with a given database

Current plan is to only support MySQL / Postgresql

Plan
- [ ] Read and parse SQL file to get table info & column info
- [ ] Read from a folder 
- [ ] Read schema from database
